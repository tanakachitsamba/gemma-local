High-priority TODOs for gemma-local (human-crafted)

1) Code quality and structure
- [x] Add pyproject.toml with ruff/black/mypy configs
- [ ] Introduce simple settings layer (env + optional YAML override)
- [ ] Split server into smaller modules if it grows (api/, core/, adapters/)
- [ ] Add request/response pydantic schemas for clearer contracts

2) Documentation & DX
- [x] Expand README: quickstart, troubleshooting, performance tips, GPU notes
- [x] Add docs/ with how-tos (install, run, tests, fine-tune, eval, docker)
- [x] Document dataset schema for fine-tune/eval (JSONL), examples included
- [ ] Write a style guide for comments and PRs (human tone, concise)

3) Testing
- [ ] Property-style tests for sse_event formatting and chunk ordering
- [x] Contract tests to pin response shapes (stream/non-stream)
- [ ] Load/smoke test script (locust or vegeta) to baseline throughput
- [x] Negative tests: invalid payloads, large max_tokens, bad stop sequences

4) MLOps & DataOps (minimal but meaningful)
- [x] Add training/train_lora.py (PEFT) with config-driven training
- [x] Add configs/train_lora.example.yaml and explain knobs
- [x] Add scripts/evaluate.py to score base vs. fine-tuned on a dataset
- [x] Add data/README.md and sample JSONL (alpaca-like)
- [ ] Add simple experiment tracking (CSV/JSONL logs) and metric summaries
- [ ] Optional: wire in Weights & Biases if available (feature-flag)

5) CI/CD & quality gates
- [x] Expand CI to run ruff/black/mypy linters
- [x] Cache pip deps for faster CI runs (Buildx cache used for Docker; pip cache can be added later)
- [x] Add test matrix (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- [x] Build and push a Docker image (multi-arch) to GHCR

6) Safety and robustness
- [ ] Rate-limit or queue requests; expose /metrics for basic observability
- [ ] Add timeout/cancellation handling for long generations
- [ ] Sanitise streaming errors with stable SSE termination

7) Future polish
- [ ] Orchestrator for multi-model hosting and model hot-swap
- [ ] Simple dataset curation utilities (dedup, length filters, splitters)
- [ ] Utility to export HF model + LoRA to GGUF pipeline

Notes:
- Keep comments crisp and human. Prefer small, readable functions.
- Avoid breaking the minimal API; layer features behind flags/configs.
